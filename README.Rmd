# twAccount

Extract a brand's Twitter timeline, visualize the brand identity through the imagery posted and 
topic model both the timeline and mentions of that brand. Topic modeling relies on the `BTM` package, which is designed for short texts as opposed to standard LDA topic modeling. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of twAccount from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("taylorgrant/twAccount")
```

## Example

The package provides an overall wrapper function `twitter_tm()` that will (1) extract a brand's Twitter timeline, (2) recent, public tweets matching a boolean search, and (3) all images that a brand has included in its publicly available tweets. 

Once the data is extracted, a model is run to estimate topic models based upon the Biterm Topic Models algorithm in the `BTM` package. Currently, the model is specified to run based on the number of topics selected by the user, rather than running through a series of topic sizes and maximizing the log-likelihood (maybe later). 

The BTM topics are then placed into 2d space using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence methodology and then scaling with PCA. For example, the 

```{r example}

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
