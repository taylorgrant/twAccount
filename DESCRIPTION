Package: twAccount
Title: Twitter Timelines, Images, and Topic Models
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Taylor",
           family = "Grant",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "taylor_grant@gspsf.com")
Description: Package extracts the timeline of a public handle and creates annualized collages of all imagery. 
    It also leverages the `rtweet` package and its `search_tweets` function to extract tweets with specific mentions. 
    Both Timeline tweets and mentions are then topic modeled using the `BTM` package.
