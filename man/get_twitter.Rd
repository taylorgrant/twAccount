\description{
Extract 3,200 tweets from a timeline, extract all pictures and save timeline
as a .rds file to new folder. Note that this creates a new directory in the current
working directory. "~/working_directory/account_analysis/handle/Sys.Date" Imagery
search also creates new folders for each year and also a /final_collage/ folder where
all images from each year are appended into a single image.
}
\details{
If search_query is added, function also pulls 18,000 recent tweets matching the query.
Mentions are also saved into the .rds file.

Heavily reliant on the \code{rtweet} package. Read the package tutorial for how to
set up Twitter API authorization.
